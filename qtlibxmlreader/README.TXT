libxml2 reader v2.1

A SAX2 parser based on libxml2, with a QXmlReader interface.



Notes:

The libxml2 library is typically preinstalled on Linux systems.
For other operating systems, source is available from
http://xmlsoft.org Before building, the file
src/qtlibxmlreader.pri must be edited to specify the paths to the
include and library files of the libxml2 installation.
